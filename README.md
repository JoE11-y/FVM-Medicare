# FVM Medicare

## Decentralized Medical Records

FVM Medicare enables people to store, retrieve, and share their medical records on FVM by giving our clients a mechanism to store their data safely, persistently, and decentralizedly.

First, the user connects with their wallet. After signing up, they mint an NFT of their medical records after which they can use the NFT to access the platform.

First, we used Solidity to deploy into FVM.

Although we believe the project has a wonderful future and we are proud of the extent we took the project to, we still have a lot of refining to do and in need of large amount of domain knowlegde from qualified practitioneers in the medical field. The project has potential and we're super happy to come this far in building the project as a team.
